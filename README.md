## Lean Agent OS MDC Files

This fork streamlines Brian Casel’s original **Agent OS** instruction set for solo builders who need
fast, low‑token context in tools like Cursor or Claude Code.

### What’s different?
* 📉 60‑80 % smaller files — same behavior, less chatter  
* 🏃‍♂️ Designed for o3 / o4‑mini budgets  
* 🔐 Strict execution, rollback, and thinking loops added

### Credit
Huge thanks to **Brian Casel** and the [Builder Methods / Agent OS](https://github.com/buildermethods/agent-os) project for the original concept and structure.  
This repo simply adapts that work for a lean, single‑developer workflow.

## Original Agent:

[Agent OS](https://buildermethods.com/agent-os) transforms AI coding agents from confused interns into productive developers. With structured workflows that capture your standards, your stack, and the unique details of your codebase, Agent OS gives your agents the specs they need to ship quality code on the first try—not the fifth.

Use it with:

✅ Claude Code, Cursor, or any other AI coding tool.

✅ New products or established codebases.

✅ Big features, small fixes, or anything in between.

✅ Any language or framework.
